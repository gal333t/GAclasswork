GA Classwork Week 1 
Basic HTML & CSS - mostly a Javascript exericse as per below

Write an HTML page which asks the user two questions (using prompt)

What burger would you like?
Would you like fries with that (yes/no)?
For the first question, the user can type in anything. For the second question, we expect a "yes" or "no" answer.

If they answered "cheeseburger" and "yes", your website should display:

So that's 1 cheeseburger with fries.
If they said "no" to fries, it should say:

So that's 1 cheeseburger, no fries.
Extension: If they said yes to fries, also ask what size fries.

Extension 2: Allow them to choose quantities of the burger and fries.

Extension 3: Make up prices for your menu items, display them on the page, and calculate and alert the user of their total price based on their order.

Extension 4: Make your menu look pretty using CSS. Choose a nice font, add some images!
